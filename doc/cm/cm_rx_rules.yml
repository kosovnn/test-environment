    Configuration information related to Rx classification rules.

      type: none
      d: |
         Rx classification rules
         Name: none
         Value: none

    - oid: "/agent/interface/rx_rules/table_size"
      access: read_only
      type: uint32
      d: |
         Name: none
         Value: rules table size

    - oid: "/agent/interface/rx_rules/spec_loc"
      access: read_only
      type: bool
      d: |
         Whether special rule locations are supported
         Name: none
         Value: 1 if supported, 0 otherwise

    - oid: "/agent/interface/rx_rules/last_added"
      access: read_only
      type: int64
      volatile: true
      d: |
         Location of the rule added the last time.
         This value is reset every time a new rule is added on TA
         (even if for a different interface). This object is useful
         when you add a rule to a special location (first/last/any)
         and its real location in rules table becomes known only
         after committing it. It is assumed that user gets the real
         location of the added rule from this node right after
         adding it, before adding another rule.
         Name: none
         Value: index in rules table or -1

      d: |
         Rx classification rule
         Name: location in rules table.
               Location is an index in the table. However for newly
               created rules which are not committed yet it can also
               be "any", "first" or "last" if special insert locations
               are supported. Use last_added to find out real index
               just after a new Rx rule commit. If special insert
               locations are used, test should not try to restore
               configuration using history - restore by backup must
               be used.
         Value: none

      d: |
         Rx queue index
         Name: none
         Value: Queue index or -1 if packets should be discarded;
                default is 0. If RSS context is specified, this
                value must be nonnegative and will be added to
                Rx queue Id get from indirection table in that
                RSS context.
