    The prototypical usecase is as follows:
    - suppose there's a possibly large NV storage
    - and there are read-only and read-write tests
    - naturally, read-only tests would expect some known contents of a storage,
      while write tests spoil it
    - it is infeasible to re-initialize the whole device even before each
       session of read-only tests.
    - it is also not very robust to require that all write tests
      to clean up after themselves

    Instead a test that changes the content of a data block, record its position
    and extent in this subtree. Then at some point an epilogue or a prologue
    processes all the regions under a given tag and restores their content.

- register:

    - oid: "/local/changed"
      access: read_create
      type: none
      d: |
         The subtree grouping changes related to a certain entity.

         Name: arbitrary tag identifying some entity (e.g. a block device)
         Value: none.

    - oid: "/local/changed/region"
      access: read_create
      type: string
      d: |
         Test Agent subtree.

         Name: start of a region
         Value: extent of a region

         The name and value would usually be integral values,
         but it is not mandated here, because specific usecases may
         require some non-numeric values such as "end" or the like
